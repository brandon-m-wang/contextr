# contextr.io - a social network

beta-testing v0.0.1 results:

- pfp image can only accept valid file extensions otherwise site will break
- see all friends needs to be it's own scrollable view
- make it so pfp images onload doesnt append but instead just modifies src or at least check if site load triggers after the first 2 or so pfp load -- too slow
- dont post if the post contents are only spaces
- like and delete comments
- crop pfp function
- no paste on bio
- p tag on comments needs to shrink
- fix timezones (should be easier than i previously thought?)
- optimize friends page loading
- optimize click events so they load with dynamically generated prompt images and not at the end of post loading
